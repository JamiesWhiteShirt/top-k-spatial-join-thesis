\chapter*{Abstract}
Given two sets of spatial objects \(R\) and \(S\) where each object is assigned a score, a spatial join predicate (such as a point distance threshold), and an aggregate function that combines scores for two objects (such as a simple sum), the top-k spatial join operation joins \(R\) and \(S\) by the spatial predicate and returns the \(k\) pairs with the best scores according to the aggregate function. The R-tree is a common spatial data structure that is a balanced search tree designed to accelerate spatial queries, which can be applied to evaluate spatial joins. Some methods have been proposed for the evaluation of top-k spatial joins, but they have not been explicitly designed for parallelism.

Graphics processors are becoming commodity hardware, and their massively parallel processing capabilities can be used to achieve high performance. APIs such as CUDA have enabled the trend of general-purpose computing on graphics processors (GPGPU), which has become a popular way to utilize this hardware. However, special application design is required to efficiently utilize GPGPU, which requires new research to adapt to the new computing paradigm. It has been shown that some spatial queries can be sped up significantly with GPGPU, but little research has been made into processing top-k spatial joins (and top-k queries in general) with graphics processors.

This thesis covers important aspects of processing top-k spatial joins using R-trees on GPU\@. Research suggests that some existing methods have potential to be adapted for GPGPU. We deal with some of the challenges that come with adapting applications for GPGPU. We define an R-tree memory layout designed for efficient random access in global memory, a bulk loading implementation based on GPU segmented radix sort and parallel reductions, and an adaptation of the Block-based algorithm for top-k spatial joins that utilizes varying degrees of parallelism.
